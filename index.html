    <h3><small class="text-muted">Software Engineer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I work on the Payments team at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/jobs/locations/seattle">Dropbox Seattle</a>, which designs and maintains the infrastructure for collecting payments from customers. I previously worked on the Subscription Growth team, which handles the engineering and experimentation for Dropbox's signup/purchase flows.</p>

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Data Visualization Researcher</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In 2017 I graduated from UC Berkeley with an M.S. in Computer Science. Advised by Prof. Joseph Hellerstein in the RISELab, I studied database systems and researched techniques to enable interactive data visualizations for latency-sensitive workloads. Check out some of my <a href="/projects#pubs">publications</a>.</p>

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Photographer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I currently shoot with a Sony a6300, 35mm f/1.8, and 19mm f/2.8. I love my lightweight mirrorless setup, and really enjoy outdoor landscape and night photography. Check out some of my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/larryxu/">photos</a>. Although I like to shoot a lot, I post very infrequently.</p>

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Boardgamer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I have a quickly growing collection of board games small and large, and always looking to add more. Social deduction games such as Mafia, Resistance, Coup, and Secret Hitler are among my favorite.</p>
