    <h3><small class="text-muted">Software Engineer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I work at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/jobs/locations/seattle">Dropbox Seattle</a> on the Payments team, which designs and maintains the infrastructure for collecting payments from our customers. Previously I worked on the Subscription Growth team, which handles the engineering and experimentation for Dropbox's signup/purchase flows.</p>

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Visualization Researcher</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 with an M.S. in Computer Science. Advised by Prof. Joseph Hellerstein in the RISELab, I studied database systems and researched techniques to enable interactive data visualizations for latency-sensitive workloads. Check out some of my <a href="/projects#pubs">publications</a>.</p>

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Photographer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I shoot photographs with my Sony Œ±6300 camera, and my 35mm f/1.8 and 19mm f/2.8 lenses. I love my lightweight mirrorless setup, and really enjoy outdoor landscape and nighttime photography. Although I like to shoot a lot, I post very infrequently.

    <h3><small class="text-muted">Boardgamer</small></h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I play board games regularly and am always looking to add more games to my collection. My favorite genre is social deduction, which includes games such as Mafia, Resistance, Coup, Bang, and Secret Hitler. One day I hope to design and create a game of my own.</p>
